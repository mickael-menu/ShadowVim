## Prevent Xcode from indenting the code

To avoid conflicts between Xcode and Nvim's auto indentation, Xcode's should be disabled. We can check it out with `defaults read -app xcode`.

## Color scheme

The color scheme from Xcode (`defaults read -app xcode`) could be used for the ShadowVim status bar.
